# Teacher Cascade Evaluation
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Teacher Cascade Evaluation" system, which is designed to evaluate teacher competence based on our data-driven cascaded Neural Network model. More details can be found in our paper: "A Unified Cascaded Neural Network Framework for Interpretable and Adaptive Teacher Competence Evaluation".

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.8
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pytorch etc.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/SVIL2014/teacher_nn_cascade_evaluation.git

## Usage
open the dl_cascade_***.py file, and run this file 

## Dataset
To be more specific, the information gathered from the university is systematically saved in a file named teacher_info***.csv, ensuring its easy access and management for further reference and analysis.
